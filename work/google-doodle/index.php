                 <p>I chose to make it autumn themed simply because it was that time of year, and I enjoy the changing colors of the leaves.</p>
                 <p>I wanted the leaves to be completely random by size, color, and even movement so I extensively used the <code>random()</code> function included in Sass to accomplish that.</p>
                 <p>I used a dash of vanilla JavaScript to create all the leaves, but otherwise everything is done in CSS.</p>";
